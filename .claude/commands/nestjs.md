# NestJS Development Assistant

Help with NestJS development for $ARGUMENTS

## Task

I'll help you with NestJS development by:

1. Creating modules, controllers, services, guards, pipes, and decorators
2. Setting up database entities and repositories with TypeORM
3. Implementing authentication and authorization
4. Creating WebSocket gateways for real-time features
5. Setting up testing for NestJS applications
6. Configuring middleware and interceptors
7. Implementing CRUD operations with validation

## Process

I'll follow these steps:

1. Examine your project structure and existing NestJS configuration
2. Understand your database setup (TypeORM, entities, migrations)
3. Follow your project's architectural patterns and conventions
4. Implement requested features using NestJS best practices
5. Add proper TypeScript types and decorators
6. Create comprehensive tests following your testing patterns
7. Update documentation and ensure security compliance

## NestJS Features I Can Help With

### Core Architecture
- Modules and dependency injection
- Controllers with routing and validation
- Services and providers
- Custom decorators and guards
- Exception filters and pipes
- Interceptors and middleware

### Database Integration
- TypeORM entities and repositories
- Database migrations and seeding
- Relationship management (OneToOne, OneToMany, ManyToMany)
- Query optimization and indexing
- Transaction management

### Authentication & Security
- JWT authentication strategies
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Guards for route protection
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS and security headers

### Real-time Features
- WebSocket gateways
- Socket.io integration
- Real-time event handling
- Room management and broadcasting
- Rate limiting for WebSocket connections

### Testing Strategies
- Unit tests for services and controllers
- Integration tests with supertest
- E2E tests with Jest
- Mocking dependencies and databases
- Test fixtures and factories

## Project-Specific Conventions

Based on your connecto-nest project:
- Use entity-first CRUD pattern with `@foryourdev/nestjs-crud`
- Follow modular architecture in `src/modules/`
- Use TypeORM with PostgreSQL and Redis caching
- Implement WebSocket features for real-time chat
- Follow authentication patterns with JWT and social login
- Use relative imports for internal modules
- Add proper guards and validation to all endpoints

## Common Patterns

I'll implement these NestJS patterns:
- Repository pattern for data access
- Service layer for business logic
- DTO pattern for data validation
- Guard pattern for authentication/authorization
- Interceptor pattern for logging and transformation
- Exception filter pattern for error handling

I'll adapt to your project's specific NestJS version, dependencies, and architectural decisions to maintain consistency.
